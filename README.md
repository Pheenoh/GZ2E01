It builds the following DOL:

main.dol - `sha1: 4997D93B9692620C40E90374A0F1DBF0E4889395`

And will eventually build all the [RELs](./rels_sha1.md).

2. Run the executable located at `devkitPro\msys2\msys2.exe`
3. Update pacman by running the following command: `pacman -Syu`
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command: `pacman -S python3-pip base-devel gcc vim cmake`
